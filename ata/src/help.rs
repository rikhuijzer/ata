Could not find the file `ata.toml`. To fix this, use `{} --config=<Path to ata.toml>` or have `ata.toml` in the current dir.

For example, make a new file `ata.toml` in the current directory with the following content (the text between the ```):

```
api_key = "<YOUR SECRET API KEY>"
model = "text-davinci-003"
max_tokens = 400
temperature = 0
```

Here, replace `<YOUR SECRET API KEY>` with your API key, which you can request via https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.

The `max_tokens` sets the maximum amount of tokens that the server will answer with. If the model responds with more tokens, the output will be truncated.

The `temperature` sets the `sampling temperature`. From the OpenAI API docs: "What sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for ones with a well-defined answer."
